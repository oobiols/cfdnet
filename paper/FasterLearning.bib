In this thesis I implement and evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models and using these as building blocks I investigate the hypothesis that predicting the time-to-time sensory input is a good learning objective. I introduce the Predictive Encoder (PE) and show that a simple non-regularized learning rule, minimizing prediction error on natural video patches leads to receptive fields similar to those found in Macaque monkey visual area V1. I scale this model to video of natural scenes by introducing the Convolutional Predictive Encoder (CPE) and show similar results. Both models can be used in deep architectures as a deep learning module."

Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such "autoencoder" networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.},

In this thesis I implement and evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models and using these as building blocks I investigate the hypothesis that predicting the time-to-time sensory input is a good learning objective. I introduce the Predictive Encoder (PE) and show that a simple non-regularized learning rule, minimizing prediction error on natural video patches leads to receptive fields similar to those found in Macaque monkey visual area V1. I scale this model to video of natural scenes by introducing the Convolutional Predictive Encoder (CPE) and show similar results. Both models can be used in deep architectures as a deep learning module."

	abstract = {Recently, researchers in the artificial neural network field have focused their attention on connectionist models composed by several hidden layers. In fact, experimental results and heuristic considerations suggest that deep architectures are more suitable than shallow ones for modern applications, facing very complex problems, e.g., vision and human language understanding. However, the actual theoretical results supporting such a claim are still few and incomplete. In this paper, we propose a new approach to study how the depth of feedforward neural networks impacts on their ability in implementing high complexity functions. First, a new measure based on topological concepts is introduced, aimed at evaluating the complexity of the function implemented by a neural network, used for classification purposes. Then, deep and shallow neural architectures with common sigmoidal activation functions are compared, by deriving upper and lower bounds on their complexity, and studying how the complexity depends on the number of hidden units and the used activation function. The obtained results seem to support the idea that deep networks actually implements functions of higher complexity, so that they are able, with the same number of resources, to address more difficult problems.},

abstract="In this paper we demonstrate that finite linear combinations of compositions of a fixed, univariate function and a set of affine functionals can uniformly approximate any continuous function ofn real variables with support in the unit hypercube; only mild conditions are imposed on the univariate function. Our results settle an open question about representability in the class of single hidden layer neural networks. In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity. The paper discusses approximation properties of other possible types of nonlinearities that might be implemented by artificial neural networks.",

The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPyâs syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and
functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates
them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6Ã to 7.5Ã faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the
CPU and between 6.5Ã and 44Ã faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.}

                arbitrary learning machines, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional
                neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short term memory
                (LSTM), logistic regression, and maximum entropy model, that can be illustrated
                as a series of computational steps. A CN is a directed graph in which each leaf
                node represents an input value or a parameter and each non-leaf node represents a
                matrix operation upon its children. We describe algorithms to carry out forward
                computation and gradient calculation in CN and introduce most popular computation
                node types used in a typical CN.
We further introduce the computational network
                toolkit (CNTK), an implementation of CN that supports both GPU and CPU. We
                describe the architecture and the key components of the CNTK, the command line
                options to use CNTK, and the network definition and model editing language, and
